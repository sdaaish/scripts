* Certificates for the Sandbox
Certificates are installed automatically in the sandbox, if they are placed here with the extension ~.cer~

To get a certificate from the Windows certificate Store, export them with powershell.
#+begin_src powershell
$cert = Get-ChildItem  Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\| Where-Object Subject -match "mysubject"
Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath cert.cer -Type CERT
#+end_src

All certificates in the folder will be loaded in the sandbox.
